Hello Git and GitHub

## How to format your README (from [here](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

should contain only necessary information on how to start using and contributing to the project. **Longer documentation is best suited for wikis**

- **Project name** 

- **Description**: clear, short, to the point. Describe the importance of the project, what does it

- optionally: **Table of Contents** if your README is long and detailed

- **Installation**: tell users how to install your project properly, optionally include a gif to make the process even more clear

- **Usage**: instruct how to use after installing, include screenshots of your project in action

- **Contributing**: larger projects often have sections of contribution guidelines, sometime in a seperate file. Explain your specific contribution preferences to let other developers know how to best contribute to your work

- **Credits**: to highlight and link to the authors of the project

- **Licence**: more info [here](https://choosealicense.com)
